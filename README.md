# Module 01 : Introduction of Generative AI (Gen AI) 			#

## What is Generative AI

Traditionally machine learning is used to predict and take decission based on input data and trained models.
Difference in Gen AI is it can generate new contents rather than supporting only in decision making.
Few examples for generative AI are creating a code snippet using chat GPT or creating a new image using DALL-E

## What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of AI used to train and develop models which perform specific tasks which human brain is capable of doing.
For training models you will need huge amount of data and algorithms which can use those data to train the models

## What is Deep Learning

Deep learning is used to deal with much more complex problems in machine learning not only for identifying objects or taking simple decission.
They are the replication of how human brain operates with cluster of neurons to process some information and get an output out of that.
'Neural network' is one of the ket technology used to perform Deep learning to solve the complex problems.

Below is a hierarchical diagram which described how each of these are linked

## What is Garbage in - Garbage Out Terminology
When we train a model with a garbage data it can produce only garbage output which are not fit for the purpose 
This is a common terminology used in machine learning. 

## What is ChatGPT
ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI. 
It is designed for natural language understanding and generation, specifically in a conversational context. It can also remember the context of the conversation as it progress.

# Module 02 : Understanding Key Terminologies in LLM	

## What is Large Language Model (LLM)
Large language Models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence models designed for understanding and generating human like text. just like auto proposed words while typing in WhatsApp.
LLM only handles text generation in the LLM, it is not responsible for image or audio or music or code or video. 
LLM uses neural networks behind the scene to process and predict word by word and produce the result. It only predicts one next word at a time and provide as output.

Below is a diagram which represents how neural networks works.

## Key Points on LLM

### Pre Training on LLM
LLM are trained on huge corpus of data that is why it is used as Large Language Model to help with language, sentiment, grammar etc.
ChatGPT is trained on more than 500GB of text data which includes entire wikipedia etc. 

### Size and Scale
It uses massive amount of neural networks such as transformers with billions of parameters to train the model. Higher the number of parameter better the performance of your model.
ChatGPt is trained on 500 billions of parameters. 

### Fine Tuning 
We can tune an existing LLM model to fine tune to further for a specific purpose, For example training a model with medical language.  

## Use cases for LLM
It can be used mainly for few of the below purposes. 

- Content Generation 
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
- Language Translation
- Text Summarization
- Q & A

## What is a Prompt Engineering

Prompt is a specific question, command or input that you provide to an AI system to request a particular response, information or action. 
To get better results you will need to ask questions with more relevant context, that is what Prompt engineering standards for. 

For example the type of below two questions may vary its response and accuracy. 

- How is the weather look like in Bangalore 
  - Ans : The current weather in Bangalore is partly cloudy with temperatures around 29째C during the day and 14째C at night
- How is the weather look like in Bangalore during June Month 
  - Ans : In June, Bangalore typically experiences hot and humid weather with temperatures ranging from 21째C to 30째C. It's also the beginning of the monsoon season, so you can expect high rainfall, averaging around 125 mm for the month. There are usually about 5 days of rain during this time)

## How to create a better Prompts 
To get better results always make sure we write better prompts while asking question to LLM / GPT, few of the considerations could be 

- Clearly convey the 'desired response' 
- Provide 'context or background' information
- Balance 'Simplicity and Complexity'
- Iterative 'testing and refinement'
