## What is Generative AI

Traditionally machine learning is used to predict and take decission based on input data and trained models.
Difference in Gen AI is it can generate new contents rather than supporting only in decision making.
Few examples for generative AI are creating a code snippet using chat GPT or creating a new image uisng DalE

## What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of AI used to train and develop models which perform specific tasks which human brain is capable of doing.
For training models you will need huge amount of data and algorithms which can use those data to train the models

## What is Deep Learning

Deep learning is used to deal with much more complex problems in machine learning not only for identifying objects or taking simple decission.
They are the replication of how human brain operates with cluter of neurons to process some information and get an output out of that.
'Neural network' is one of the ket technology used to perform Deep learning to solve the complex problems.
